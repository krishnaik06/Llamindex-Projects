You will need a Google Gemini API Key to run this app. If you want to use OpenAI's ChatGPT then you need to provide that also.

Steps to install and use this app:

Step 1: Run the  `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.

Step 2: Create a file named `.env` where you will store your API keys.

Step 3: Put the API Keys in the following format: 

        GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
        
        OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
        
Step 4: Run the `streamlit run DocGPT.py` to run the app.
